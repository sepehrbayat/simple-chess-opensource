## Description (Short - 160 characters max)
A complete open-source chess game with AI opponent, move evaluation, and beautiful UI. Built with Python and Pygame. Perfect for learning game development and AI algorithms.

## Full Description
A feature-rich, open-source chess game implementation built with Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates:

- **Complete Chess Implementation**: All standard chess rules including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion
- **AI Opponent**: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for intelligent gameplay
- **Move Evaluation**: Real-time move quality scoring (0-100) based on material, position, and strategy
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Play against another player, against AI, or watch AI vs AI
- **Beautiful UI**: High-quality graphics with custom piece rendering and visual feedback
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured, object-oriented code perfect for learning and extending

Perfect for:
- Learning chess programming and game development
- Understanding AI algorithms (minimax, alpha-beta pruning)
- Studying Python and Pygame best practices
- Educational purposes and portfolio projects
